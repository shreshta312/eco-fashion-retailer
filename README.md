## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreshta312/eco-fashion-retailer.git
```

2. Open the project folder in VS Code.

3. Install the Live Server extension.

4. Right-click on `index.html`.

5. Click **Open with Live Server**.

## How the Project Works

The project stores product information in `data/products.js`.

JavaScript files dynamically render products, handle search, manage cart operations, save checkout details, simulate payment, generate order confirmation, and display invoice details.

The project uses `localStorage` for storing:

- Cart data
- Registered users
- Current logged-in user
- Current order
- Past orders

## Main Pages

- `index.html` - Homepage
- `pages/clothing.html` - Clothing products
- `pages/accessories.html` - Accessories products
- `pages/beauty.html` - Beauty products
- `pages/cart.html` - Shopping cart
- `pages/checkout.html` - Checkout form
- `pages/payment.html` - Payment simulation
- `pages/order_conf.html` - Order confirmation
- `pages/invoice.html` - Invoice page
- `pages/login.html` - Login page
- `pages/register.html` - Register page

## Limitations

- This is a frontend-only project.
- There is no real backend.
- There is no real database.
- Payment is only simulated.
- Login/register data is stored in browser localStorage.
- Data is stored only in the user's browser.

## Future Scope

- Convert the project to React
- Add backend using Node.js, Express, or FastAPI
- Add a real database using MongoDB or MySQL
- Add real authentication
- Add admin dashboard
- Add seller dashboard
- Add wishlist feature
- Add product filters and sorting
- Add real payment gateway integration
- Add order tracking system
- Add product reviews and ratings
- Improve recommendation system
